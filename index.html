        <p>
          This is a brief information page about limerence, which has been
          getting more attention in recent years.

        <h2>What is limerence, exactly?...</h2>
        <p>
          Limerence is defined as a state of intense romantic obsession. The
          best way I'd personally describe it is a "crush on steroids," though
          it is nothing like a crush.<br /><br />The term "limerence" was coined
          by Dorothy Tennov, who went into detail about the subject in her 1979
          book, <i>Love and Limerence.</i> In her book, she describes this
          emotional state as having certain characteristics, including:
        </p>
        <ul class="example-list">
          <li class="example-item">
            intrusive thinking about the object of your passionate desire (the
            limerent object or "LO"), who is a possible sexual partner;
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">acute longing for reciprocation;</li>
          <li class="example-item">
            dependency of mood on LO's actions or, more accurately, your
            interpretation of LO's actions with respect to the probability of
            reciprocation;
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            inability to react limerently to more than one person at a time
            (exceptions occur only when limerence is at low ebb—early on or in
            the last fading);
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            fear of rejection and sometimes incapacitating but always unsettling
            shyness in LO's presence, especially in the beginning and whenever
            uncertainty strikes;
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            acute sensitivity to any act or thought or condition that can be
            interpreted favorably, and an extraordinary ability to devise or
            invent "reasonable" explanations for why the neutrality that the
            disinterested observer might see is in fact a sign of hidden passion
            in the LO;
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            buoyancy (a feeling of walking on air) when reciprocation seems
            evident; and
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the
            background.
          </li>
        </ul>

          life coach Stephanie Lazzara lists some common misconceptions about
          limerence, including:
        </p>
        <ul class="example-list">
          <li class="example-item">
            <b>Limerence is "just a crush."</b> As stated before, this is not
            the case. Unlike a normal crush, limerence involves intense,
            intrusive thinking and interferes with other aspects of one's life
            to the point of disruption.
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            <b>Limerence is something you can "get over."</b> This idea can
            cause shame in those who experience it, as they are unable to easily
            recover from the intense emotions that come from it.
          </li>
          <li class="example-item">
            <b>Limerence is all about attraction.</b> WHile attraction is a
            factor, much of limerence stems from a need for emotional connection
            with and attention from someone, which itself stems from other
            factors.

        <h2>Why is this important?...</h2>
        <p>
          Most of us have fallen in love at least once in our lives, or at least
          have felt something like it. Learning about limerence, and other
          states of mind like it, brings us one step closer to understanding
          ourselves and how our thoughts and emotions affect our daily lives.
