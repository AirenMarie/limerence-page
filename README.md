This is my mini project for Module 1.

I almost didn't make this page and opted for something more difficult because the topic was more personal to me. I ultimately chose it because of its simplicity and the time it would take to complete it in comparison with other ideas.

I chose to use semantic HTML to ensure ease of accessibility and SEO. I used JavaScript to toggle between the article and the survey, so that the article could be shown once the survey was submitted. I also hid the navigation menu while showing the survey in order to keep things consistent.
