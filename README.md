This is my mini project for Module 1.

I almost didn't make this page and opted for something more difficult because the topic was more personal to me. I ultimately chose it because of its simplicity and the time it would take to complete it in comparison with other ideas.

I chose to use semantic HTML to ensure ease of accessibility and SEO. My original plan was to use JavaScript to toggle between the article and the survey, so that the article could be shown once the survey was submitted, and to hide the navigation menu while showing the survey in order to keep things consistent. However, since this has proven difficult to properly execute, I have excluded the JavaScript for the time being by commenting out the code until I can find a way to get everything working properly.
